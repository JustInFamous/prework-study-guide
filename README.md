# Prework-Study-Guide

## A Study Guide for Course Pre-work


- My motivation for this project is pretty simple. I wanted to start the bootcamp on the right foot. I was scared that if I did not do this project I would have been lost or behind throughout the entire course. By doing this project I have become much more familiar with the subjects we will learn, such as being introduced to and using JavaScript. Also by having done this project I think I am more prepared for the rest of this bootcamp, than if I had skipped this project
